# Part 1: Learning Exercises

# Exercise 1: Variables and Assignments
# Assign values to variables and calculate their sum.
# Example: Assign 10 to a and 20 to b. Calculate their sum.
# a=10
# b=20
# c= a + b
# print(c)

# print 3 statements
# hello
# my name is Nitesh
# my hobby is XXX
# print("hello")
#print("my name is nitesh")
#print("my hobby is fishing")

# u put a hash in front of the code to comment
# purpose 1: leave notes to tell pple/ yourself what this code is doing
# purpose 2: to "hide" codes from python

# x = 1000
# y = 205000
# z = x + y
# print(z)


#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2: Adding Comments
# Add a single-line and a multi-line comment in this code.
# Example: Add comments to explain what the code does.
# Single-line comment



#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3: String Concatenation
# Combine two strings to make a greeting.
# Example: Assign "Hello" to greeting and "John" to name.
# Combine them to display: "Hello John".
# name = "John"
# print("Hello, " + name)  # the plus sign joins sentences together in this case
# hobby= "cycling"
# print(name + " like " + hobby)

#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4: String Repetition
# Repeat a phrase multiple times to create a pattern.
# Example: Print the phrase "Python is fun! " three times.
# msg = "Python is fun!"
# print(msg * 3)



#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 5: Combining Variables
# Use variables to create a descriptive sentence.
# Example: Assign "Python" to language and "awesome" to
# adjective. Combine them to display: "Learning Python is
# awesome!"
# language = "English"
# adjective = "so so"
# print("Learning " + language + " is " + adjective)

# Part 2. IN-CLASS Practice Exercises

# Exercise 1: Variables and Operations
# Subtract two numbers stored in variables. Try changing them.
# Example: Assign 15 to x and 5 to y. Calculate x - y.
x= 15
y= 5
answer= x-y
print(answer)



#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2: Adding Comments to Code
# Add comments to explain each line in this code.
# Example: Store first and last names, combine them, and
# print a greeting.

first_name = "Alice"  # Store first name
last_name = "Tan"  # stores last name      
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name # the full name 
print("Welcome, " + full_name + "!") # welcome the person using full name  




#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3: String Concatenation
# Combine variables into a full sentence.
# Example: Assign "sunny" to weather and "picnic" to activity.
# Combine them to display: "It is a sunny day for a picnic."
weather = "sunny"
activity= "picnic"
print(" it is a "+ weather +" day for a " + activity )





#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4: String Repetition
# Use repetition to create a patterned message.
# Example: Print "Go! " five times to display: "Go! Go! Go!
# Go! Go!"
print(" GO "* 5)
