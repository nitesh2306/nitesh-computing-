# Task 2
# In Singapore, electronic road pricing (ERP) is implemented
# on various expressways to regulate traffic.
#
# Lately there has been a change in the ERP rates at 5 gantries across some expressways.

# The following program calculates the change in rates of these 5 gantries.

for i in range(5):
    expressway = input("Enter name of gantry:")
    old = float(input("Enter old rate:"))
    new = float(input("Enter new rate:"))
    change = new - old
    print("Change is",change)

# Your program code and output for each of Tasks 2 should be saved
# in a single .ipynb file using JupyterLab. For example, your program
# code and output for Task 2 should be saved as:
#  TASK2___.ipynb

#  Make sure that each of your .ipynb files shows the required output in JupyterLab.
# For each of the sub-tasks, add a comment using the hash symbol '#'
# at the beginning of your code to indicate the sub-task
# that the program code belongs to.
