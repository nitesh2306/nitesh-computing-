# What is my Chinese Zodiac sign?
# In not more than 10 lines of code, write a program to calculate the Chinese Zodiac sign based on a user's year of birth. (hint: it can be done in 5 lines)

# The most common method depends on Chinese New Year, which is considered as the division of two animal years. When a lunar year comes to an end, the animal will shift to next one. Chinese peopleâ€™s animal signs are marked by this method.

# How to Calculate Your Chinese zodiac sign mathematically?
# Divide your year of birth by 12 and get the remainder. Each remainder corresponds to an animal sign below.

# 0: Monkey 1: Rooster 2: Dog 3: Pig 4: Rat 5: Ox 6: Tiger 7: Rabbit 8: Dragon 9: Snake 10: Horse 11: Goat

# Sample Output

# Enter your birth year: 1977

# Your Chinese zodiac sign is: Snake
